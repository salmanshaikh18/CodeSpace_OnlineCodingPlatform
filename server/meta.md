## Usage of tsc --init

The `tsc --init` command is used to create a `tsconfig.json` file in your TypeScript project. This file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler options. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to your project directory** (the directory where you want to create the `tsconfig.json` file).

3. **Run the command:**
   ```sh
   tsc --init
   ```

4. **The command will generate a `tsconfig.json` file with default settings.**

Here's an example of what a generated `tsconfig.json` file might look like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",                          
    "module": "commonjs",                     
    "strict": true,                           
    "esModuleInterop": true,                  
    "skipLibCheck": true,                     
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true  
  }
}
```

### Key Options in `tsconfig.json`

- **`target`**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version.
- **`module`**: Determines the module system used in the output.
- **`strict`**: Enables all strict type-checking options.
- **`esModuleInterop`**: Enables emit interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules.
- **`skipLibCheck`**: Skips type checking of all declaration files (*.d.ts).
- **`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`**: Disallows inconsistently-cased references to the same file.

You can customize the `tsconfig.json` file according to your project's requirements by adding or modifying options. For detailed documentation on all available compiler options, you can refer to the [TypeScript Compiler Options documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).

## Difference between npm i packagename and npm i @types/packagename

When working with Node.js and TypeScript, you may encounter both `express` and `@types/express`. These packages serve different purposes:

1. **`npm i express`**:
   - **Purpose**: Installs the Express framework, which is used for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
   - **Content**: Contains the actual code for the Express framework.
   - **Usage**: Required to run your Express application.

   ```sh
   npm i express
   ```

2. **`npm i @types/express`**:
   - **Purpose**: Installs the TypeScript type definitions for Express.
   - **Content**: Contains TypeScript type definitions, which help the TypeScript compiler understand the types used in the Express framework.
   - **Usage**: Helps in providing type-checking and auto-completion features when using Express in a TypeScript project. It is particularly useful for development but not required to run the application.

   ```sh
   npm i @types/express
   ```

### Summary

- `express`: The actual Express framework library needed for your application to function.
- `@types/express`: TypeScript definitions for Express, which are helpful for development purposes in TypeScript projects but not necessary for running the application itself.
